# Metaheuristic-Optimized Extreme Learning Machines for Sleep-Disordered Breathing Screening

Reproducibility code for the paper **"Early Screening of Sleep-Disordered Breathing Using Metaheuristic-Optimized Extreme Learning Machines"** (Thaher, Sheta, Ashqar, Chantar, Surani), submitted to *Diagnostics* (MDPI).

> 📄 Paper link / DOI: _to be added on publication._

The study trains a lightweight **Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)** whose hidden-layer weights and biases are optimized by **metaheuristic algorithms** (via the [IntelELM](https://github.com/thieu1995/IntelELM) framework over [MEALPY](https://github.com/thieu1995/mealpy) optimizers), and benchmarks it against eight conventional classifiers for early screening of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) / sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) from structured clinical predictors.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Samples | Features | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SDB** | 500 | 10 | **Included** (`Dataset/sdb_dataset.csv`). Derived from the public Kaggle dataset [ziya07/sleep-disordered-breathing-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/sleep-disordered-breathing-detection). |
| **OSA** | 274 | 31 | **Not included.** Clinical data available from the corresponding author on reasonable request, subject to data-sharing restrictions. |

> **Reproducibility scope:** the study uses **two** datasets, but only **SDB** is publicly redistributable. The SDB experiments therefore reproduce **end-to-end from this repository** (data + code). The **OSA** experiments require the restricted OSA dataset, which is **not** included here — obtain `OSA-data.csv` from the corresponding author (see [Data availability & ethics](#data-availability--ethics)), place it in `Dataset/`, and point the configs at it.

`Dataset/sdb_dataset.csv` is the model-ready file (10 numeric predictors + binary `Diagnosis_of_SDB`, where Mild/Moderate/Severe → 1 and None → 0). To regenerate it from scratch, download the raw file from the Kaggle link above and run `preprocess_kaggle_data.ipynb`.

To run the **OSA** experiments, obtain `OSA-data.csv` from the corresponding author, place it in `Dataset/`, and point the configs at it (see below). It is git-ignored so it cannot be committed accidentally.

## Installation

Developed with **Python 3.9** (Anaconda).

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # or use conda
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing the experiments

Both pipelines run on the **SDB** dataset out of the box and repeat each experiment over 20 stratified 80/20 splits, writing per-run and aggregated metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, confusion-matrix counts, timings) plus ROC and convergence figures.

**1. Baseline classifiers** — run from the repository root:
```bash
jupyter notebook main_baselines.ipynb     # Run All
# outputs -> Results/
```
Models and hyperparameters are defined in `models.py`; run settings (test size, number of runs, seeds, data path) in `config.py`.

**2. Metaheuristic-optimized ELM** — run from inside the `ELM_MHs Framework/` folder (its modules import by bare name):
```bash
cd "ELM_MHs Framework"
jupyter notebook main_mha.ipynb           # Run All
# outputs -> Results_MHA/  (written at the repository root)
```
ELM/optimizer settings (hidden size, activation, objective, search bounds, runs) are in `config_mha.py`; the set of optimizers that run is controlled by `ACTIVE_OPTIMIZERS` in `optimizers_config.py`.

**Switching to the OSA dataset:** set `DATA_PATH`/`TARGET_COL` in `config.py` and `DATA_PATH` in `ELM_MHs Framework/config_mha.py` to your `Dataset/OSA-data.csv` (target column `class`).

## Revision analyses (statistics, imbalance, feature importance)

Three self-contained packages reproduce the additional analyses reported in the paper. Each has a `run_*` driver and unit tests (`pytest <package>`):

```bash
python -m comparison.run_osa            # statistical comparison + confusion matrices  -> Results_comparison/
python -m imbalance.run_sdb_imbalance   # SMOTE / ADASYN / threshold tuning on SDB      -> Results_imbalance_SDB/
python -m importance.run_importance     # permutation + SHAP feature importance         -> Results_importance/
```

The statistical comparison runs on the **already-generated** per-run metrics in `Results/` and `Results_MHA/`, so it reproduces the reported tables without re-training. Pre-computed outputs are included in the `Results*` folders for reference.

> **Note on the included OSA outputs.** The raw OSA dataset is not redistributable, but the OSA *result* files shipped here (e.g. `Results_MHA/Results OSA/sleep_apnea_test_all_runs.csv`) contain only aggregate per-run metrics and per-feature importance scores — no patient-level data — so the statistical analyses on the OSA results reproduce from this repository even though the OSA experiments cannot be re-run without the restricted data.

## Models

- **Baselines (8):** Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM (RBF), MLP, XGBoost, and a standard ELM. Hyperparameters are fixed (no tuning search); see `models.py`.
- **Metaheuristic-optimized ELM:** the hidden-layer weights/biases are searched with metaheuristics from the evolutionary, math-based, physics-based, and swarm families — GA, RUN, MEO, CL-PSO, HI-WOA, GWO, HGS, HHO, SeaHO, MGO, and the hybrid GWO-WOA. Each optimizer uses 100 iterations, population size 30, cross-entropy objective, and a [-1, 1] search space; 20 independent runs.

The included `Dataset/sdb_dataset.csv` is a **processed subset**: 10 structured predictors plus a binary `Diagnosis_of_SDB` label (Mild/Moderate/Severe → 1, None → 0); the preprocessing is in `preprocess_kaggle_data.ipynb`.
